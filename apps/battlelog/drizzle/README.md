# Battlelog database migrations

Maintain `src/database/schema.ts` directly. Run `bun run db:generate` to derive
SQL migrations and Drizzle snapshots from it, review the artifacts, then apply
them with `bun run db:migrate:deploy`. Keep historical SQL and snapshots;
database introspection must not overwrite the source schema.

## Object cleanup

Apply `20260904192453_pending_object_deletions` before deploying the Battlelog
cleanup worker. Removing a battle and recording its object deletion intent
commit in one database transaction. The record and public link disappear
immediately; object storage cleanup can complete later.

The worker polls every five seconds, processes at most 100 records with four
concurrent deletions, and retries failures after one minute. It invalidates
analytics and removes the R2 object before deleting the intent. Repeated
deletion of an already absent object is safe.

Inspect pending cleanup without loading battle payloads:

```sql
SELECT "battleId", "userId", "createdAt", "retryAt"
FROM "battle_object_deletions"
ORDER BY "retryAt";
```

After restoring Redis/R2 connectivity, retain these rows for the worker to
drain. Do not drop the table during rollback; older versions do not process
it, so retain a compatible worker until the backlog is empty. The migration
cannot recover object identifiers lost by deletions before it was installed.
`db:migrate:init` adopts only the historical schema; it never marks this new
migration as applied without executing its SQL.

## User-scoped battle submissions

`20260909045921_scoped_battle_submissions` replaces the global submission ID
index with uniqueness on `(userId, submissionId)`. Existing rows are preserved;
different users may subsequently use the same submission ID. Reusing an ID with
a different battle payload for the same user returns HTTP 400. Equivalent
retries retain the original battle ID, and R2 uploads use `If-None-Match: *` so
an already accepted object is never replaced. A failed initial upload can still
be retried without inserting another battle. Legacy submissions without a
stored semantic fingerprint return their original ID without changing metadata
or replacing raw data; unverified retry content cannot repair those old objects.

Deploy this change as a coordinated write cutover: stop and drain the old
Battlelog writers, apply the migration, then start the updated service. Do not
run old and new writers together: old code performs global submission lookups,
and new code requires the composite index for its conflict target. Keep game
clients retrying failed submissions during the cutover. Do not restore the old
runtime or global unique index after different users have reused a submission
ID; use a forward fix or a compatible release. No existing battle records should
be deleted to make a rollback succeed.
